# Exploring object tracking with ARKit
Stroke affects more than ten thousand Singaporeans every year. For many survivors, the way doctors currently assess the knock on effects is still very manual, imprecise, and heavily dependent on observation.

Together with the NUH Department of Rehabilitation, I am developing a 3D hand eye coordination assessment tool for hand dexterity in Swift and SwiftUI, built with ARKit and RealityKit for the Apple Vision Pro. The test measures how closely a patient can follow an ideal path between two points, capturing even the smallest deviations in finger movement.

This project has taken me through the full Software Development Life Cycle, from gathering requirements to design and build, and it is now in clinical trials.
